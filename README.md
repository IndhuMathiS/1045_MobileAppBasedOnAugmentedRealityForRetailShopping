7.About (Short Description / Summary):Android powers millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It’s the largest installed base of any mobile platform and growing fast every day, another million users power up their Android devices for the first time and start looking for apps, games, and other digital content. Android is a software bunch comprising not 
only operating system but also middleware and key applications. In this project, we  present an android  application using Augmented Reality which allows a user to try on virtual Jewels. The user pose and depth is tracked using the mobile’s camera and virtual jewels are aligned with the tracked user. The jewel moves and folds realistically and the lighting intensity of the jewel rendered
is adapted to match ambient lighting conditions. The presented application improves on related augmented reality application by adding user pose tracking and by using jewel models combined with jewel simulation instead of 2D images.

8.Install (Installation procedure): Step by step procedure to install software.
